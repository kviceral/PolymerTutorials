# PolymerTutorials
Code based on the tutorials from LevelUpTuts. The code wasn't linked so here it is if anyone is interested.

# Tutorial Link

# Changes based from the tutorial
I named my class differently (contact-item) on the last video. I don't like contact-listing and contact-list. I think they should be more descriptive.

# Notes
Some interesting notes after trying out the tutorial
* You apparently can't have an element name without a dash [link](https://github.com/divshot/ele-web/issues/22)
* Regarding video #5 You can now have `<h1>{{firstName}} {{lastName}}</h1>` instead of wrapping both `{{obj}}` in a `<span>` as of Polymer 1.2.0
